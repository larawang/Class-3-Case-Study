**Overview and Origin**
Robinhood Markets, Inc. is an American financial services company which was founded on April,2013. Robinhood is famous for offering commission free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds via mobile app. Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt are Robinhood’s founders. The concept of Robinhood is to “provide everyone with access to the financial markets, not just wealthy”. The idea is coming from that the traditional stock trading platforms not only have minimum account requirements, but also charge costly transaction fees that keep lots of users out of these conditions especially young investors.  Robinhood revenue depends on three main sources which are interest earned on customer’s cash balance, selling order information to high-frequency traders, and margin lending. According to Crunchbase’s data, Robinhood has raised a total of $5.6billion from 55 investors. 

**Business Activities**
As a privately held company, Robinhood makes money by passing its customer trades along to bigger brokerage firms and get payments from these firms. Because of no minimum account requirements and commission free, Robinhood attracted lots of young investors. To make small profits but quick turnover by reducing the investment threshold to attract scattered investors, therefore they will earn from customer’s cash balances. Robinhood stripped out the services that come with almost all other competitors streamlines the product so that they didn’t have a strong customer service, analytics and other services, but the UI of the App is easy to understand, and some necessary items like limited orders are gradually completed. To ensure the stability of backstage and trading platform is one of the projects they need to solve in order to protect customer’s profit. 
Robinhood uses 22 technologies to support its application and data included Python, React, NGINX, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, RabbitMQ, Sass, and etc. To support its utilities, Robinhood uses Google Analytics, Elasticsearch and Retrofit. 24 technologies for example Github, Git, Docker, Sentry and etc. are used for app developing. 

**Landscape**
Robinhood’s financial industry domain is Robo-advisors and personal finance. Other companies in this domain are Acorns. Robo-advisors are services that use computer algorithms to build and manage a client’s investment portfolio which require little human interaction. “Personal finance are professionals you may hire, on an ongoing or temporary basis, to help manage aspects of your financial life — from investing to estate planning and more. “ (Voigt, 2021)  Personal finance are pretty popular in the last 5-10 years but its trends are gradually decreased with the emerging of Robo-advisors. 

**Result**
Because of COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment, as well as general Borden stemming from worldwide lockdowns led many people enter the stock market. Stimulus checks and the stay-at-home policy directed many towards investing via Robinhood. During the time between January 2020 to April 2020, 3 million accounts have been opened on Robinhood that giving opportunities to new generation of investors access to the stock market. As of 2020, Robinhood had 13 million users. Such a massive influx of retail traders has caused an impact on the stock market. A flood of new investors into stock market has led to a rise in trading volume that causes some stocks are overvalued. Robinhood is one of the earliest stock trading platforms adhering to the principle of free commission fees and no minimum account requirements, thus attracting a large number of young investors. Compared with other traditional trading platforms, Robinhood app design and operation are very simple. But with the popularity of Robinhood, there are now similar trading platforms such as Moomoo. 

**Recommendations**
As a regular Robinhood user, my personal experience is that the simplicity of the Robinhood interface and operation with no fees were what attracted me to it in the first place. My first recommendation is to see Robinhood categorize all stocks with some basic data analysis as a guide for young, inexperienced investors. Because the concept of Robinhood is to provide everyone with access to the financial markets, not just wealthy. Robinhood does that. But if there is more guidance for inexperienced users, it would be more helpful and popular. The technology that Robinhood can be used probably is predictive analytics. This technology is intended to make suggestions to new users or help them to avoid risks or make decisions.
